In React, `createContext` is a function that is used to create a Context object. Context provides a way to share data or state across multiple components in a React application without having to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree.

### When to Use `createContext`

- **Global State Management:** When you need to manage global states like user authentication, theme settings, or language preferences.
- **Avoiding Prop Drilling:** When you want to avoid passing props down through many levels of components just to get the data to a deeply nested component.

### How `createContext` Works

1. **Creating the Context:**
   You create a context using `createContext`, which returns a Context object. This object contains two components:

   - **Provider**: A component that supplies the context value to the tree of components that need it.
   - **Consumer**: A component that consumes the context value.

   ```javascript
   const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
   ```

   The `defaultValue` is optional and is used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.
2. **Providing Context:**
   The `Provider` component is used to wrap the part of your component tree where you want the context value to be accessible. You pass the value you want to share as a prop to the `Provider`.

   ```javascript
   <MyContext.Provider value={sharedValue}>
     <ChildComponent />
   </MyContext.Provider>
   ```
3. **Consuming Context:**
   There are two main ways to consume context in your components:

   - **Using `useContext` Hook:** This is the most common way in functional components.

     ```javascript
     const value = React.useContext(MyContext);
     ```
   - **Using `Context.Consumer`:** This is often used in class components or when you need to access multiple contexts.

     ```javascript
     <MyContext.Consumer>
       {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
     </MyContext.Consumer>
     ```

### Example Usage

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

// 1. Create a Context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
  // 2. Provide the Context to components
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemeButton() {
  // 3. Consume the Context
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
      style={{ background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}
    >
      Toggle Theme
    </button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Summary

- `createContext` allows you to create a context object for sharing data across your React component tree.
- You use a `Provider` to make the context available to a subtree of components.
- Components within that subtree can access the context value using the `useContext` hook or `Context.Consumer`.

This pattern is powerful for managing state across large React applications, particularly when dealing with deeply nested components.
